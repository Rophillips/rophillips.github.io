Project Title - Responsive Portfolio
Created to build up my portfolio. As a beginner, I chose to build this project using a bootstrap template and modifying it's content for beginning my portfolio.
I've included what I have learned so far in Rutgers Bootcamp.
Used bootstrap css framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio.
Included responsive buttons to websites, used google images and linked to the sites.
